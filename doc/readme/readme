This is a springboot demo with multiple modules.

So...

If you need this demo,find file folder 'sqlfile' in 'doc' and run sql statements in Navicat or whatever(must support mysql),change database user/password settings or something else in each application-dev.yml,and then run the modules inside.

Maybe you'll run into some trouble,but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't stop you.

Stand together with Wuhan!
