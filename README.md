This is a springboot multiple data source demo.

So...

If you need this demo,find file folder "sqlfile" and run sql statements in Navicat or whatever(must support database 'mysql'),change user/password settings and so on in application.yml.

Maybe you will meet few troubles,but i believe they would not stop you.

And...

Congratulations!We have done!



PS:

It's pretty late now.My country is suffering from a virus attack.I hope we would survive from this new virus.And...

Good night,earth!
