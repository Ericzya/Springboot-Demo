This is a springboot demo with multiple modules.

So...

If you need this demo,find file folder "doc-sqlfile" and run sql statements in Navicat or whatever(must support database 'mysql'),change user/password settings or something else in each application-dev.yml,and run the modules inside.

Maybe you will meet few troubles,but I believe they would not stop you.




PS:

It's pretty late now but I still can't sleep.Cause my country is suffering from SARS-CoV now and many people died.We are segregating ourselves now.Things seem to be getting worse day by day.I do hope my friends would survive from this new virus.

And I hope I can say goodbye to earth everyday.
