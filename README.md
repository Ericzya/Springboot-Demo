This is a springboot demo with multiple modules.

So...

If you need this demo,find file folder "doc-sqlfile" and run sql statements in Navicat or whatever(must support database 'mysql'),change com.cctv.springbootdemo.model.user/password settings or something else in each application-dev.yml,and run the modules inside.

Maybe you will meet few troubles,but I believe they would not stop you.
